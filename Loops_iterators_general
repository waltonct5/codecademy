=begin
An *iterator* is just a Ruby method that repeatedly invokes a block of code
The simplest iterator is the loop method. You can create a basic (but infinite!) loop by simply typing:

loop { print "Hello, world!" }

In Ruby, curly braces ({}) are generally interchangeable with the keywords do (to open the block) and end (to close it). 
Knowing this, we can write a smarter loop than the one above:
=end

i = 0
loop do
  i += 1
  print "#{i}"
  break if i > 5
end

# break - breaks a loop as soon as its condition is met.
# next - skip over certain steps in the loop.

for i in 1..5
  next if i % 2 == 0
  print i
end
 
=begin
In the above example, we loop through the range of 1 through 5, assigning each number to i in turn.
If the remainder of i / 2 is zero, we go to the next iteration of the loop.
Then we print the value of i. This line only prints out 1, 3, and 5 because of the previous line.
** To check if ODD: i % 2 == 1
=end
