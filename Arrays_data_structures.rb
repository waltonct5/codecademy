Arrays are just storing multiple values in a VARIABLE to late LOOP AND ITERATE

remember: each element in the array has what's called an index; begins at 0

We can access elements of the array directly through these numbers using brackets
=end

my_array = [1,4,3,7,5]
array[4]
# returns "5" since "5" is at index 4

# An array (like a line) is one-dimensional; an array of arrays (like a square) is two-dimensional.

my_2d_array = [[1, 1], [1, 1]]
