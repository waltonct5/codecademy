=begin like a backward while
first create a variable i and set it to 0 (zero).
Then we execute a block of code until i is equal to 6. That block of code increments i.
When i is equal to 6, the block ends.
Finally, we print 6, the value of i, to the console.
=end

i = 0
until i == 6
  i = i + 1
end
puts i

counter = 1
until counter > 10
puts counter
   counter = counter + 1
end
# ==> returns 1-10

# Update the variable values with assignment operators
  counter += 1
